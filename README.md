# Synthetic AI for Colorblind Solutions

Welcome to the **Synthetic AI for Colorblind Solutions** repository! This project aims to explore how synthetic data and AI-driven techniques can enhance visual accessibility for individuals with color blindness by generating colorblind-friendly visual data.

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model developed to create synthetic images tailored for colorblind individuals. The model simulates three primary types of color blindness:

- **Deutan**: Red-green color blindness.
- **Protan**: Another form of red-green color blindness.
- **Tritan**: Blue-yellow color blindness.

By leveraging synthetic data generation, this project aims to:

1. Improve accessibility in data visualization.
2. Enable testing and optimization of visual designs for colorblind users.
3. Provide a hybrid solution integrating filtering techniques with AI models.

## Repository Contents
